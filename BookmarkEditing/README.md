# Usage
- Put the `.txt` file generated by https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpdfbookmarks/ into the same folder as `formatter_test.py`
- The script generates a new `.txt` file with the chapter/section numbers added
- Note: for best effects, one should modify the code to suit the particular pdf
  - eg to avoid adding section numbers to "Preface", add it to `avoid_these`
  - also the script ignores all bookmarks after "Bibliography"
