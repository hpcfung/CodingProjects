## Dependencies
- torch
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- (time, sys)

## Running `Autoencoder 3D plot 2.py`
- `even_mnist.csv` (the dataset) should be placed in the same directory as `Autoencoder 3D plot 2.py`
- a pdf of some of the input images and the corresponding output images from the autoencoder is generated
- an html plot containing a 3D interactive plot is generated
- total runtime should be around 3-4 minutes (100 epochs of training)
