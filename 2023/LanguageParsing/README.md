parse grammar

display grammar rules

eg color highlight

like dictionary popup, but for grammar

(computational) linguistics makes learning languages faster?

saves time from googling what grammar feature? or asking fluent speaker?

in fact, given all these cues, even sb who doesn't know the language can translate manually?


difficulty in parsing?

eg kara, karaage

need to eg parse all nouns first?

ambiguity
kara ageru

actually same problem, identifier, programming language
solved problem?

existing similar software? parsing, grammar highlighting
