eg kara, karaage

need to eg parse all nouns first?

ambiguity
kara ageru

actually same problem, identifier, programming language

"If you take a theory of computation course, you'll probably be treated to proof that regular
expressions cannot match some common patterns that occur in programming languages,
particularly patterns that nest instances of the same pattern inside themselves. This

parsing in romaji, hiragana, or with Kanji?

either way, any of these input formats, should transform into the one used for processing

(how does it affect syntax highlighting tho)
