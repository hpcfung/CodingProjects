most info in `config/.yaml` file  
`dataset`: so many `null`?  
how does graph embedding work?

```
yaml_path = f"config/"
main(config_path=yaml_path, config_name=config_name)
def main(config_path: str, config_name: str):
```

training data format  
eg `data/delta_-1_545`
```
config.json
dataset.h5
graph.json
```

weight source target? where do the weights come from?

figure out what dataloader does?
