eg use share

open reddit -> open pixiv link -> Chrome browser, in app? -> use share on top right?


android app open another app

### Alternatives

actually, just open link in chrome? problem: pixiv in Chrome is very slow?

actually after logging in chrome, the Chrome pop up is automatically logged in

ie this project is not necessary
