- Converted `.csv` into `.npy`
- Plotted them as pictures with their labels, picture looks like picturse, the labels match.
- checked softmax should use `dim = 1` to normalize the 5 output dims
- actually that is not necessary, cross entropy loss in pytorch also includes softmax
- plotted with one hot encoding again, still works
- actually cross entropy loss doesn't need one hot encoding
